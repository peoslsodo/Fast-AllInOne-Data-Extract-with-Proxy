<h2><strong>Why do you needed Fast AllInOne Email Extractor with Proxy?</strong></h2>
<p>
    1. Avoid Getting Blocked: Most websites have restrictions on the number of requests that can be made from a single IP address within a given time period.
    If you try to extract email addresses without using a proxy, your IP address may get blocked, making it impossible to continue extracting.
</p>
<p>
    2. Anonymity: When using a proxy, your real IP address is hidden, and the website you are extracting from will see the IP address of the proxy server instead.
    This helps to keep your online activities anonymous and protects your privacy.
</p>
<p>
    3. Faster Extraction: By using a proxy, you can make multiple requests simultaneously, which speeds up the extraction process.
    This is especially useful when extracting a large number of email addresses.
</p>
<p>
    4. Access Geo-restricted Websites: Proxy servers can be located in different countries around the world, allowing you to access websites that may be blocked in your country.
    This is useful if you need to extract email addresses from websites that are not accessible in your geographical location.
</p>
<p>
    5. Cost Savings: By using a proxy, you can rotate your IP address and avoid getting blocked, which means you won't have to
    constantly invest in new IP addresses to continue your email extraction. This can save you
</p>



<h2><strong>Important</strong></h2>
<p>
    <strong>In non-proxy mode</strong>, it is easy to block your IP by google,
    and you cannot get the result (wait for 10 minutes and then you can)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>In proxy mode</strong>, you don't have to worry about IP being blocked, we use proxy polling.<strong>
        (You need to import your stable http proxy list)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you don't know how to purchase a stable http proxy, our documentation contains instructions on how to proxy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>In proxy mode, With free proxies</strong>, data collection may often fail!
    because free proxies are very unstable (not software problem)
